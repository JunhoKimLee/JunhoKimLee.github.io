Hi! My name is Junho Kim-Lee and I am majoring in Computer Science at the Cornell University College of Engineering with an external specialization in Applied Economics & Management. Since I started coding in high school, I have become proficient coding in over 10 languages as well as working with data structures, algorithms, machine learning, databases, and Amazon Web Services. I am also experienced with writing software for both public and private institutions- namely NASA and Amazon.

I have a strong interest in the intersectionality of tech and business, which I gained experience in working at General Motors as a product management intern on the In-Vehicle Applications team. Through my external specialization I have also become proficient in topics ranging from marketing research to consumer behavior to macroeconomics.

As a side hobby, I am a videographer for a dance team at Cornell. I love to find new and innovative ideas for shots, and to date I have produced over 30 videos.

Thanks for visiting my website!
