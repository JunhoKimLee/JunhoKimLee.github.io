A neural network that forecasts election results based on previous voting data of past elections.

For the final project of my machine learning class, I was tasked with a partner to implement a machine learning algorithm that will take training data containing county-level social and economic factors and predict the results of future elections, where the outcome is not known. As a benchmark for this project's success, the program was tested for accuracy against the 2016 presidential election. We coded a ReLu neural network in a Jupyter notebook and used supervised learning to fine tune parameters to produce an algorithm with a prediction accuracy of 74.51% using the benchmark test data.
