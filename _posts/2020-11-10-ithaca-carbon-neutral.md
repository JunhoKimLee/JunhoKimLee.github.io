A Python script designed to be compatible with a custom Diva-for-Rhino Grasshopper template to automate the process of running large swaths of energy simulations at a time.

As part of my project team, Cornell University Sustainable Design, I was tasked on the Ithaca Carbon Neutral project. In order to meet the standard of having the city of Ithaca be carbon-neutral by 2030, I was tasked with designing energy-saving retrofits for existing buildings in the city of Ithaca using Diva-for-Rhino and the Grasshopper plugin. To determine the most cost-efficient combination of retrofits, many time-consuming energy simulations had to be run in a row. To save time, I built this automater that injects Python code into a Grasshopper template so that the user can pre-configure multiple use cases and then let all the simulations run in a row with a single click.
