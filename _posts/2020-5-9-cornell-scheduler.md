Cornell Scheduler is a tool for Cornell students to build their class schedules. The Scheduler takes user-inputted schedule preferences and then generates and ranks schedules for the user.

For my final project for my Functional Programming course, I wrote a Cornell class scheduling tool using OCaml. The 1800-line program builds permutations of all possible schedule configurations based on user-inputted semester and class IDâ€™s. Then, the system deletes all conflicting and duplicate schedules and uses an algorithm to rank them based on user-inputted preferences. The user then has the luxury of viewing the schedules in a polished visualizer displayed to the terminal window.
