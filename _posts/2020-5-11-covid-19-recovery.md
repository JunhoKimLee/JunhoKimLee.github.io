For my final project for my Engineering Probability and Statistics course, I did a statistical study investigating the recovery period of symptomatic COVID-19 patients for the purpose of better anticipating how the virus will progress and affect hospital loads at a time when not much was known about the disease. I did this by conducting an analysis of the relationship between confirmed cases and recovered cases using statistical R tools to deduce, with a high level of statistical certainty, how long it takes, on average, for patients to recovery. The primary statistical tools used were Q-Q plots and linear regressions.
